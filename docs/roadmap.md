# Roadmap

This file distinguishes two levels:

- **Current Implementation Roadmap** — the actionable near-term plan that
  decides the next PR. It preserves completed work and the current state.
- **Directional Capability Roadmap** — long-term product context: capability
  progression and dependencies, not a delivery calendar, a fixed build order, or
  an implementation authorization.

This file contains no dates, estimates, release promises, fixed sequence
commitments, or completion percentages. GitHub Issues remain the place for
executable tasks.

## Current Implementation Roadmap

DeepPlant ships the project foundation plus two executable semantic vertical
slices:

- minimal domain model: `PlantModel` -> `Plant` + `list[Equipment]`
- equipment-owned `Port` objects; port identity is local to the owning equipment
- top-level `Connection` edges over structured `PortRef(component, port)`
  endpoints
- reference validation: every endpoint component must resolve to existing
  equipment and its port must exist on that equipment
- YAML load through a small boundary into typed Pydantic models
- strict semantic input: unknown fields rejected, non-empty semantic ids,
  unique equipment ids, unique port ids per equipment item
- a runnable example: `examples/minimal-process/plant.yaml`
- `deepplant validate <path>` reporting plant, equipment, port, and connection
  counts

`Connection` is currently a directed semantic topological relationship from
`source` to `target`; it remains topology only and is not yet a pipe, process
stream, signal, cable, or physical line. Work proceeds as small vertical
changes with executable tests. The next topology concept is deliberately
reconsidered before implementation, not auto-selected.

### Completed

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Define `PlantModel` | Root container and composition of the model |
| Define `Plant` | Plant identity: `id`, `name` |
| Define `Equipment` | Engineering objects: `id`, `type`, `name`, owned `Port[]`; no fixed taxonomy yet |
| Define `Port` | Typed connection points owned by equipment; id local to the owning equipment |
| Define `PortRef` | Structured endpoint reference: `component` + `port` |
| Define `Connection` | Directed semantic topology only: `source`/`target` as `PortRef(component, port)`; not a pipe/stream/signal/physical line yet |
| Reference validation | Connections resolve to existing equipment and owned ports; referential integrity only |
| YAML load | YAML as serialization, validated via Pydantic into the domain model |
| Semantic validation (structural) | Non-empty ids; unknown fields rejected; unique equipment ids; unique port ids per equipment |
| First executable example | `examples/minimal-process/plant.yaml` runs through the CLI |

### Backlog (Suggested Order)

The pipes/streams modeling question was researched in
[process-topology.md](process-topology.md), which proposes a layered model:
`Connection` stays pure topology; a separate `ProcessStream` entity comes first
(process/PFD layer); a physical `PipingLine` entity follows later (P&ID layer).
The decision is **not resolved**:

> Human review must approve or reject the proposed process-topology model before
> any semantic-model implementation.

Do not implement pipes/streams semantics from habit or because rendering needs
it; the review decides from the real-fragment evidence in the research document.

| # | Item | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Review and approve/reject the proposed process-topology model | Human decision on `docs/process-topology.md`; no semantic-model implementation until then |
| 2 | YAML save / round-trip | `load`/`save` symmetry once the model needs persistence |
| 3 | SVG symbol specification | Deliberate symbol spec, separate from semantics |
| 4 | Basic renderer | Derive a simple PFD/P&ID-like drawing from the model |
| 5 | DEXPI adapter spike | Prove import/export feasibility on a real fragment |

### Milestones

### Milestone 1 — validated YAML load

> DeepPlant can load a small process model from YAML, validate its semantic
> structure and report invalid references through the CLI.

Complete: structural validation and reference validation ship in the first two
slices.

### Milestone 2 — prototype fragment and renderer

> DeepPlant can represent a real process fragment of roughly 20–50 engineering
> objects, render it as a basic PFD/P&ID-like diagram and validate at least 10
> classes of engineering/model consistency errors.

### Next Task

Human review of the proposed process-topology model
([process-topology.md](process-topology.md)). If approved, the next vertical
change implements the approved first increment (a separate `ProcessStream`
entity) on a real fragment with tests. Rendering, YAML save, and DEXPI stay out
of scope until that decision lands.

### Scope Discipline

- No database, ORM, web backend, containers, or external services.
- No empty architecture trees before real code exists.
- Schema and model design come from real example fragments, not abstraction.
- `Connection` is topology only; do not attach pipe/stream/signal engineering
  semantics until a real requirement justifies them.

## Directional Capability Roadmap

The stages below describe where DeepPlant may ultimately go. They are
**directional**: hypotheses about capability progression and dependencies, not
dates, release promises, commitments, or a guaranteed build order. A stage is
implemented only when its text says so; its presence never authorizes building
its architecture today (see the Anti-Roadmap at the end of this file).

The overall direction in one picture:

```text
Semantic plant model
        ↓
Topology and relationships
        ↓
Process streams / piping semantics
        ↓
PFD / P&ID rendering
        ↓
Interactive engineering editor
        ↓
Git diff / CI / engineering review
        ↓
Standards and DEXPI interoperability
        ↓
Engineering validation and rules
        ↓
Simulation and calculation adapters
        ↓
Safety / HAZOP / SIS workflows
        ↓
Multi-discipline engineering
        ↓
AI-assisted engineering workflows
```

The map is directional, not an implementation order.

### Stage 1 — Semantic Core

Goal: represent basic engineering objects explicitly and validate their
structure. Example concepts: `Plant`, `Equipment`, `Ports`, `Connections`,
identity, references.

Relationship to today: the core primitives of Stage 1 are implemented on
`main` — `PlantModel`, `Plant`, `Equipment`, equipment-owned `Port`,
`PortRef`, directed `Connection`, reference validation, YAML load, and
strict structural validation. Implemented primitives are not the same as a
completed capability stage: the Stage 1 exit signal below has not yet been
demonstrated on a real process fragment. The open pipes / process-stream
representation question — the first item on the Current Implementation
Roadmap above — is the next semantic decision.

Exit signal:

> A small real process fragment can be represented faithfully enough to be
> useful outside the original drawing.

### Stage 2 — Process Topology

Goal: represent meaningful connectivity and distinguish different engineering
relationship concepts.

Open questions (deliberately unresolved here):

- process stream vs pipe vs generic connection
- equipment nozzles
- instrumentation connectivity
- utilities

### Stage 3 — Engineering Views

Goal: derive human-readable engineering diagrams from the semantic model.
Likely capabilities: PFD rendering, P&ID rendering, symbol library,
presentation/layout model, manual layout override. Semantic and presentation
models stay separate.

### Stage 4 — Interactive Editing

Goal: let engineers modify the semantic model graphically without making the
drawing the source of truth. Potential surfaces: PFD/P&ID editor, property
editor, symbol placement, connection editing. Directional only; it does not
justify web architecture now.

### Stage 5 — Git-native Engineering Workflow

Goal: make semantic change review a first-class engineering workflow. Potential
capabilities: semantic diff, CI validation, PR review, model consistency checks,
generated reports.

### Stage 6 — Standards and Interoperability

Goal: exchange models with established engineering ecosystems (DEXPI, COMOS,
AVEVA, and other engineering tools).

Invariant:

> External representations are adapters, not the canonical DeepPlant model.

### Stage 7 — Engineering Rules

Goal: automate deterministic engineering checks. Examples may eventually
include: reference integrity, required properties, topology consistency, company
engineering rules, and selected standards checks. No standards compliance is
claimed that is not implemented.

### Stage 8 — Simulation and Calculations

Goal: connect semantic plant data to calculation and simulation tools. Potential
targets: DWSIM, SysCAD, the CAPE-OPEN ecosystem, and specialized engineering
calculations. The canonical model must not become simulator-specific.

### Stage 9 — Process Safety

Directional only. Potential future capabilities: HAZOP support, safeguards,
SIS / SIL concepts, reliability structures, and traceability between hazards and
safeguards. Nothing here implies automated safety approval.

### Stage 10 — Multi-discipline Engineering

Potential future expansion: process, mechanical, instrumentation, control,
electrical, documents, and requirements. The generic
`Component -> Port -> Connection` direction may eventually support multiple
disciplines, but that does not justify generalizing today's code.

### Stage 11 — AI-assisted Engineering

Goal: agents operate on the same explicit semantic engineering model as
engineers. A future workflow might be:

```text
Engineer:
"Add a standby pump parallel to P-101."

Agent:
changes semantic model
        ↓
Git diff
        ↓
validation
        ↓
updated engineering views
        ↓
human review
```

AI should operate through explicit engineering models and validation rather than
silently editing opaque documents.

## Anti-Roadmap — What Must Not Be Implemented Prematurely

> The directional roadmap provides product context, not implementation
> authorization. Implement only the currently scoped vertical slice.
>
> A future stage appearing in the roadmap is not sufficient justification to
> introduce its architecture today.
>
> Do not add abstractions, dependencies, or infrastructure for future stages
> until a current vertical slice requires them.

Concrete examples:

- the simulation stage does not justify simulator interfaces now
- the editor stage does not justify web architecture now
- the multi-discipline stage does not justify generic entity hierarchies now
- the DEXPI stage does not justify DEXPI-shaped domain objects now
- the open pipes/streams representation question does not justify attaching
  pipe or process-stream semantics to `Connection` now

Think broadly about the destination. Build narrowly in the current iteration.
